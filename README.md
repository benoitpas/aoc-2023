# [Advent of code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) in Scala3

Scala3 has matured a lot since 2020, when I last did the [advent of code with it](https://github.com/benoitpas/advent-of-code-2020). 

So after python (and Excel !) in [2021](https://github.com/benoitpas/advent-of-code-2021) and haskell (and Excel again when possible !) in [2922](https://github.com/benoitpas/advent-of-code-2021), let's give it another go ! Probably no Excel this year but maybe a bit of [ZIO](https://typelevel.org/projects/) or the [cats ecosystem](https://typelevel.org/projects/).
